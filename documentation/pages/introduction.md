# MoveTK: the movement toolkit
MoveTK is a library for computational movement analysis written in C++. The library has been developed as part of a collaboration between [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/) , [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://alga.win.tue.nl/) and [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/algorithms/geometric-computing) under the [Commit2Data](https://commit2data.nl/en/commit2data-program/data-handling/data-science-voor-veranderende-data-2/analysis-and-visualization-of-heterogeneous-spatio-temporal-data) program.

## Overview
MoveTK is a reusable, well tested, high performant, feature-rich library that incorporates state of the art algorithms for understanding movement.
The library is designed to be extensible such that it can be adapted to various movement analysis tasks.
It's design is inspired by the designs of [CGAL](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal) and [GUDHI](https://github.com/GUDHI/gudhi-devel).

You can use this library to:

- Develop applications for processing (geo) spatial movement data at scale
- Create high performance applications for analysis of movement data, using the algorithms available in the library

Some examples are shown below:

## Quick Start
1. Install Docker on your machine see the installation instructions for instance, for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Ubuntu Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

2. Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 6013:8888 -p 80:80 -it aniketmitra001/movetk
```

3. Follow instructions in the output of step 2 to open Jupyter Notebook in a web browser. Replace port number 8888 with 6013 (or another port depending on your configuration)


4. Once JupyterLab can be accessed from your browser, in-order to access the notebooks please navigate to ```/tutorials/cpp``` for the C++ notebooks and  ```/tutorials/py``` for the python notebooks

**Notes** : 

- On Mac it is important to start Docker from Docker Desktop , so that ```localhost``` of the container gets mapped to the ```localhost``` of the host machine. This will allow the documentation to be rendered in Jupyter notebooks.  
- If you are running a ```docker build``` yourself, it it important to ensure that at least 4GB of memory has been allocated to the docker container 


##  Build Artifacts 

A push event to the master branch of MoveTK triggers a set of continuous integration (CI) [workflows](https://github.com/heremaps/movetk/actions). If the worflows are sucessful, this results in the following artifacts to be generated

- A Docker image. Do ```docker pull aniketmitra001/movetk:latest``` to get the image
- A RPM & DEB package. If the latest run of the CI workflow for [MoveTK-CI-Ubuntu](https://github.com/heremaps/movetk/actions?query=workflow%3AMoveTK-CI-Ubuntu+branch%3Amaster) is successful, select the last run. The packages can be found on the *Artifacts* section.   

## Installation with cmake

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/heremaps/movetk.git
```

2. Replicate the  steps in corresponding YAML files

    -[Mac](https://github.com/heremaps/movetk/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-macos.yml)

    -[Windows](https://github.com/heremaps/movetk/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-windows.yml)

    -[Ubuntu](https://github.com/heremaps/movetk/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-ubuntu.yml)
